[Pig Pong](zombie-pig-pong.herokuapp.com)
=======================

## What is this?

This is a project for the Makerthon week (week 8 at Makers Academy).
We decided to build a realtime game, where you are a farmer and you have to avoid the zombie pigs bouncing around.

## How to run it
Clone the repository
```
SSH:
$ git clone git@github.com:matteomanzo/PigPong.git
HTTPS:
$ git clone https://github.com/matteomanzo/PigPong.git
```
Change into the directory
```
$ cd PigPong
```
Install the NodeJS dependencies
```
$ npm install
```
Run all the tests
```
$ make all
```
Run it locally using `node server.js`, then visit `http://localhost:9999`.

## Favourite Code Snippet

~~~
var game = new Phaser.Game(700, 400, Phaser.AUTO, 'game-mainpage', { preload: preload, create: create, update: update, render: render });

game.physics.startSystem(Phaser.Physics.ARCADE);

group = game.add.group();
group.enableBody = true;  
group.physicsBodyType = Phaser.Physics.ARCADE;
game.time.events.loop(5000, createBall, this);
~~~
This is the part of code where we initialise the game and define how big our canvas will be.
Choose what physics to use and enable the body of the object to collide with other objects.

## Job List

- [x] Character can be hit by the ball
- [x] Multiple balls gets generated after a certain amount of time
- [x] Can register the Highscore

## Still to complete/refactor

- [ ] Web Sockets for multiplayer game
- [ ] Character can shoot
- [ ] Game tests
- [ ] Phisycs to be improved, bird view

## Takeaway

Being able to understand and use new technologies like Phaser, and spent a lot of time designing how to implement the app before we wrote a single line of code.
